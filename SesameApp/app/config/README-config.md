You can see here that we’ve got an images.js file which manages paths to various images in our app, routes.js file which gives us a single place to access all of our routes, settings.js file which has info such as our server URL, and finally styles.js file which has global colors in it.
This gives us one easy place to go to to manage various configuration items. It’s also nice for when people who aren’t familiar with the code (such as designers) to jump in and swap out an image.
This isn’t very intimating and there’s no chance of messing up the logic of your app.
